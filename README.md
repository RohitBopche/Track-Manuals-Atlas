# Track Manuals Atlas

An offline knowledge base and 3D knowledge graph of Indian Railways manuals, starting with six track manuals and built to take more, with a chat that answers only by quoting the manuals (manual, paragraph and page for every statement). Formerly "RDSO-Drawings"; the repository keeps that name until it is renamed in GitHub settings. This is an independent tool, not an official RDSO product.

_Historical prototype title: RDSO Universal Track Infrastructure Digital Twin & Multi-Drawing Assembly Suite._

**Developed for:** Track Analytical Cell, Bhusawal Division, Central Railway, Indian Railways  
**System Classification:** Offline 3D Engineering Digital Twin, Modular Component Assembly Suite & Continuous Learning Knowledge Graph

> **Current status (read this first).** This README was written for the early 3D digital-twin prototype. The project is now an offline

> The single authoritative record of what exists, how well it works and what is still open is
> [`docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md`](docs/PROJECT_MASTER.md) (section 37 onward). Statistics and engineering claims in the sections below

## 1. Executive Problem Statement: What Problem Does This Project Solve?

Indian Railways operates one of the densest and heaviest railway networks in the world. As the network transitions toward **25-tonne heavy axle freight corridors** and **160 km/h semi-high-speed passenger operations (Vande Bharat / Rajdhani)**, track turnouts (points and crossings) represent the single most critical and failure-prone operational asset:

### A. The Turnout Safety & Derailment Crisis
- **40%+ of all yard and mainline derailments** on Indian Railways occur within switch and crossing zones.
- Turnouts are dynamic mechanical structures subject to extreme horizontal lateral thrusts, wheel-impact transfer forces across crossing gaps, and tongue rail flexure under dynamic wheel flanges.

### B. The Cross-Disciplinary P-Way vs. S&T Interface Conflict
- Railway infrastructure has historically suffered from fragmented departmental coordination between **Civil Engineering (Permanent Way / P-Way)** and **Signal & Telecommunication (S&T)**:
  - **The Drive Rod Collision Issue:** In earlier revisions (Alt 10 and below of RDSO/T-6155), the M.S. Flat Tie Bar between Sleepers 03 and 04 was completely flat. When S&T installed modern **Clamp Point Locks (`RDSO/S-3454`)**, the point machine drive rod fouled directly against the flat tie bar during switch throwing. This caused intermittent point detection failure, signal failures, and manual emergency interventions.
  - **The Engineering Fix (Detail 'B'):** RDSO Alt 12 engineered **Detail 'B'**, introducing a **222 mm drop bend with a 485 mm span** and 12 mm sleeper clearance. However, field P-Way staff frequently lacked clear 3D spatial understanding of how the tie bar, dowels, and S&T lock integrated together, leading to improper field installations.

### C. The Fatigue & Dipped Joint Problem
- Early Thick-Web Switch revisions utilized a **Machined Joint ('M')** at the Junction of Rail Heads (JOH) at Sleeper 13. Under repeated 25t axle pounding, machined bolt holes elongated, resulting in severe joint dipping, high-frequency impact vibrations, and tongue rail fractures.
- Alt 11 resolved this by mandating a **Welded Joint ('W')**, but field teams needed visual guidelines on floating weld positions and thermal stress relief.

### D. The Maintenance Supply Chain & Component Cannibalization Crisis
- Turnout maintenance frequently suffered from prolonged speed restrictions because procurement orders omitted high-wear fastenings, washers, and pads. Field gangs were forced to cannibalize parts from adjacent lines.
- Alt 13 introduced **Note 28 and LIST - A (24 wear/breakage-prone items)** mandating a **statutory +10% spare procurement buffer** for every turnout purchase order. However, depot stores and field supervisors had no automated tool to compute spares across varying order sizes.

### E. The 2D Blueprint Static Barrier
- RDSO track standards are distributed as massive 2D engineering blueprint PDFs filled with microscopic notes, alteration blocks dating back decades, and multi-drawing cross-references.
- Field engineers, junior engineers (P-Way), and track maintainers under strict track possession time windows cannot easily parse interconnected tolerances or visualize how components assemble in 3D.

## 2. What This Project Does: The Solution Architecture

This platform is a dedicated **RDSO Railway Track Knowledge Graph Studio & Intelligent Asset Twin Platform**. Built around an enterprise-grade 3D/2D Knowledge Graph core, it provides holistic structural and operational intelligence by mapping drawings, standards, components, tolerances, interlocking interfaces, failure modes, and maintenance SOPs into a unified, interactive semantic network.

## 5. Quick Start & Offline Usage

### Running the Digital Twin & Knowledge Graph Studio
1. Simply double-click `index.html` or open it in any modern web browser:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell:
   start index.html
   ```
2. **100% Offline:** The studio uses self-contained Three.js and OrbitControls libraries in `./lib/`. No internet connection or external CDN is required.

### Validating the Canonical Knowledge Core
```bash
python scripts/validate_canonical_kg.py
```

### Compiling the Standalone Web App
**Do not run `scripts/build_updated_app.py`.** It is deprecated: `index.html` is now edited directly, and that script would overwrite it with an old template. Regenerate data with `python scripts/rebuild_all.py` instead.

### Running Automated Drawing Knowledge Extraction
```bash
python scripts/extract_drawing_knowledge.py
```

### Running Automated CDP Browser Test Suite
```bash
node tests/verify_kg_interlinking.js
```

## P0 Task Breakdown & Completion Audit

| Task ID | Item | Description | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P0.1** | Inspect current repository state | Check git HEAD, tree status, existing directories, scripts, and tests | **COMPLETE** | Inspected HEAD `104e189`. Confirmed architecture directory layout and canonical assets. |
| **P0.2** | Confirm current manual inventory | Catalog official railway manual PDFs in `manuals/` | **COMPLETE** | 6 official manual PDFs verified (IRPWM 2024, USFD 2026, AT Weld 2022, FBW 2022, Track Machine Manual 2020, Small Track Machines Manual 2024). |
| **P0.3** | Confirm current chapter/section/provision coverage | Verify canonical manuals knowledge against registry and coverage audits | **COMPLETE** | Gates F, I, J, K passed. Chapter ownership and canonical isolation strictly verified. |
| **P0.4** | Validate source registry and hashes | Audit source file references, hashes, and identity references | **COMPLETE** | Gate B (`audit_identity_references.py`) executed and passed cleanly. |
| **P0.5** | Validate evidence integrity | Check evidence pointers, references, and provenance | **COMPLETE** | Gate D (`validate_evidence_integrity.py`) executed and passed cleanly. |
| **P0.6** | Establish one unified validation command | Verify single-command validation for all publication gates | **COMPLETE** | [`scripts/validate_all.py`](../../../scripts/validate_all.py) runs Gates A through K; all 11 gates PASS with 0 errors. |
| **P0.7** | Establish reproducible regression baseline | Pytest suite and browser/CDP test baseline | **COMPLETE** | Pytest: 126/126 passed (0 failures). CDP suites for Phases 1 through 6 passing 100%. |
| **P0.8** | Add / Verify CI validation | Verify GitHub Actions workflows for continuous validation | **COMPLETE** | Verified [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [`.github/workflows/manual-kg-continuous.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/manual-kg-continuous.yml). |
